# Two Dimensional Mapping by using Single Ultrasonic Sensor

Final project as part of an introduction to embedded software and applications course, submitted by Yarin Ifargan and Avi Haimov.

* The project combined several fields such as - hardware, 
software, and robotics, based on an article from Delhi Technological University for Women. We developed a tool that controls a mobile robot, receives information, processes it, and presents a mapping of the environment. 
* we had to implement two main programs - an embedded software that defines the movement of the robot, receives the data from the sensor, processes it, and sends it to the computer via Bluetooth, and also a user interface that receives the data, store it, and finally build the mapping.
